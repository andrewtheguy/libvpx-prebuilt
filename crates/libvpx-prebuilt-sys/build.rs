// Find the prebuilt libvpx for this target and emit the link flags. What this build script
// does *not* do is the point of the crate: no configure, no make, no assembler, no cmake, no
// vendored source tree, no `cc`, and no libclang. Compare RustDesk's `scrap`, which needs
// vcpkg *and* bindgen present before it will build at all.
//
// Three places an archive can come from, tried in this order:
//
//   1. `LIBVPX_PREBUILT_DIR` — a prefix you built or unpacked yourself. Used as-is.
//   2. `prebuilt/<target>/` next to this file — what `./build.sh` + `./sync-prebuilt.sh`
//      leave behind, and gitignored, because a committed `.a` is one nobody can tell apart
//      from the one CI made.
//   3. the repository's **latest** GitHub release, downloaded once per machine into
//      `$CARGO_HOME/libvpx-prebuilt/`.
//
// (3) is what makes a fresh clone of a consuming project build with nothing installed;
// (1) is what makes it work with no network at all.
//
// Two things get hashed on the way in, and neither hash is committed to this repository:
//
//   - the downloaded `.tar.gz`, against the `SHA256SUMS` asset the release job generates from
//     the archives it just built and publishes beside them;
//   - the extracted `.a`, against the `sha256(library)` line in the MANIFEST inside the
//     archive — on every resolution path, not just the download.
//
// Both are **corruption** checks, not tamper checks: each list travels with the files it
// covers, so whoever could replace one could replace both. They earn their place because
// corruption is what actually happens — a truncated download, a cache half-written by a killed
// build, an `.a` overwritten by hand — and each of those otherwise surfaces as a page of
// undefined symbols rather than one sentence naming the file.
//
// The pin that constrains somebody *other than us* is the third-party one: libvpx.env pins the
// commit of Google's tree and build.sh refuses to compile anything else, because that is the
// supply chain this repository does not control.
//
// `releases/latest/download/…` rather than a pinned tag: a tag written in here is a tag that
// has to be updated in here. The asset name carries the libvpx version, so a release of a
// *different* version cannot satisfy the URL — it 404s naming the version rather than quietly
// returning the wrong library.
